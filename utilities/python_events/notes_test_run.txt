- [x] set fuzzy match to match based on list
    310617-Adult Race	2025 USA Triathlon Sprint and Olympic Distance National Championships
    309039-Adult Race	2024 USA Triathlon Sprint and Olympic Distance National Championships
    sanction_id         match
    310617-Adult Race   309039 Adult Race
- [x] create a consolidated list in a tab 
    use group_df then
    each event / row should be assigned a category of 
    either 2025_new, 2025_repeat, 2024_lost, 2024_repeat
    we'll make it this_year_new, this_year_repeat, last_year_lost, last_year_repeat
    include match information for each event respectively
- [x] Create common date for 2025 / this year vs 2024 / last year
    if event is in last year & has a match then assign the 2025 date
    if event is in this year & has a match then assign the 2025 date
    if no match... then take the date for the event
    also create field for common month and common year
- [x] cancel, deleted, denied - 
    if event has a match but the either the match or the event is cancel et al
    then assign a specific category

- [x] create some summary pivot tables
    = [x] load consolidated_match_data from python in mysql
    - [x] why does it print out the group df counts twice (is it running twice?)
        It wasn't running twice. A console log was printing it a 2nd time.
    - [x] setup to run as this year vs last year not hard coded 2024 / 2025 from initial sql to 

- [x] merge month shift data with consolidated match
    - [x] add in sanction id for match and other fields

    why doesn't the pivot summary match the pivot table

    load into mysql

    - [] check 2024 vs 2025 status for events that were cancelled in either

- [] load data into bq & create looker studio reportspython
- [] join to sales
