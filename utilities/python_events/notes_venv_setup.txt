Setup Instructions: How to create and use the virtual environment (venv) with requirements.txt

ON LINUX 
# Step 1: Create a virtual environment in the current folder
python3 -m venv venv

# Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install required packages inside the venv
pip install -r requirements.txt

ON WINDOWS
1. Create a virtual environment in your project directory (run this only once):

   python -m venv venv

   This creates a folder named "venv" containing the isolated Python environment.

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows (PowerShell):
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   - On Windows (Command Prompt):
     .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   - On macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):
     source venv/bin/activate

   After activation, your terminal prompt will change to show the venv is active.

3. Install the required Python packages from requirements.txt:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   This installs all necessary dependencies for the project inside the virtual environment.

4. Run your Python scripts using the venv Python:

   Once the venv is activated, simply run:

   python src/main.py --test

   This ensures your script uses the Python and packages inside the virtual environment.

5. Deactivate the virtual environment when done (optional):

   deactivate

Notes:

- Always activate the venv before installing packages or running your code.
- If you forget to activate, Python may use your system-wide packages instead.
- You only need to create the venv once. Next time, just activate it.

That’s it! You’re all set to develop using the isolated environment.
